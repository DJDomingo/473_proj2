CPSC 473 Project 2 - MVC and javascript
By: Daniel Domingo

Project allows a user to type the last name of a Student and click Search.
This searches through the data and creats a list of all matching students.
User can then click on a students name to display their course data in a table.

NOTE: Student Data is hard-coded in for testing and NOT read in from a server.
		This may be easily modified to fit other needs/purposes.
